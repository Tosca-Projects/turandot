          If not specified then the interface name will be used. If the interface names has "."
          in it then the last "." and what follows it will be stripped. E.g. interface
          "normal.1" will have mode "normal".

          This makes it easy to specify several executions for the same mode. Note that
          executions will occur in alphanumeric sorting order of the interface names.
