  Provisioning:
    description: >-
      Direction for where and how nodes for a node template are provisioned.

      "Provisioning" refers to either instantiation (creating a new node) or allocation (using an
      existing node from an inventory).

      Provisioning policies are "inherited" via node template substitution such that they would
      be applied to all node templates within the substituted service template. That substituted
      service template may override the inherited policy for specific nodes.
    properties:
      sites:
        description: >-
          Nodes will be provisioned on all listed sites.

          Note that a site may have multiple clusters. One or more of them may be selected for
          provisioning.
        type: list
        entry_schema: string
        required: false
      profile:
        description: >-
          Multiple provisioning profiles may be available, e.g. multiple service templates for
          substitution, multiple physical resources for allocation, etc.

          Setting this property will provide hints for selecting a specific profile.
        type: ProvisioningProfile
        required: false
      substitutable:
        description: >-
          When true allows the node template to be substituted by another service template, which
          must have compatible subtitution mappings.
        type: boolean
        default: true
      instantiable:
        description: >-
          When true allows nodes to be instantiated. False means that only pre-existing nodes will
          be allocated.
        type: boolean
        default: true
      virtualizable:
        description: >-
          When true allows nodes to be virtual (virtual machines or containers). False means that
          only physical nodes (baremetal) can be used. When false the "instantiable" property is
          ignored, because physical nodes cannot be instantiated, only allocated.
        type: boolean
        default: true
      substitutionInputs:
        description: >-
          These values will be used as inputs for substitution.
        type: map
        entry_schema: string
        required: false
