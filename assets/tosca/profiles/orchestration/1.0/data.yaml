      All provisioning profiles must have a name unique to the orchestration platform.

      The name can refer to a subtituted service template, which can be included in the CSAR or
      in an annotated inventory.

      Variables can be used to further specify variations for the named profile, e.g. the profile
      version, optional features, etc.
